Project: demo
Neuro MATLAB Git Demo

This repository is a demo project for using MATLAB Project + Git/GitHub in neuroscience data analysis.
It demonstrates a clean project structure that separates shared preprocessing, individual analysis, and local machine–specific settings.

Folder Descriptions
preprocess/

Shared preprocessing code used by everyone in the project.

Contains stable, well-tested functions (e.g. filtering, normalization)

Changes here affect all downstream analyses

Should be modified carefully and intentionally

analysis/

Personal or experiment-specific analysis scripts.

Each user works in their own subfolder (e.g. analysis/alex/)

Safe place to explore ideas, test models, and try different parameters

Changes here should not affect others

utils/

Small helper functions shared across the project.

Plotting utilities

Configuration loaders

General-purpose helper code

Should remain lightweight and reusable

config/

Configuration files for machine-specific settings.

config_template.m
Template showing which settings can be customized (tracked by Git)

config_local.m
Local configuration (e.g. data paths), not tracked by Git

This design allows everyone to use the same code with different local data locations.

data/

Local data directory.

Raw or processed data files

Ignored by Git (.gitignore)

Each user stores data in their own local environment

figures/

Output directory for figures and visualizations.

Generated by analysis scripts

Can be shared or ignored depending on project needs

Other Files
neuro_demo.prj

MATLAB Project file.

Defines the project environment

Manages paths and source control integration

Recommended entry point when opening the project

.gitignore

Specifies files and folders that should not be tracked by Git.

Local data

Machine-specific configuration

Temporary MATLAB files
